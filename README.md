# TikTok-research-client (Bachelor Research Project)

A Social Network Crawler in Python that, given a user or a list of users, fetches the userâ€™s followings from the TikTok API and then recursively fetches the followings of those accounts. This creates a representation of TikTok network to then compare it with other known social networks like Instagram and Meta.
